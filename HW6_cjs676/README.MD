For this project I worked with Danny F., Avikal, Geoff Shay and Adrian.  

# FBB I asked to include the link to the authorea paper in the readme. I also ask to ALWAYS include a statement of work balance: how you contribute to the project.

Also this is very confusing cause your classmates are not reporting you as a collaborator! and where is the authorea article??
