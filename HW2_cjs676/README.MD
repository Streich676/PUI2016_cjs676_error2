For this homework I worked extensively with Alexi and William and also with Shay and Kelsey and Danny.
THis homework was due at 5pm on 19 September. I requested and was granted a two day extension. I finished this homework by 5pm on 21 September. 

Assignement #1
  I took a great deal of the code from examples in the lab and the other reference material. I then worked with William to try to
  make it work, deleting and adding as necessary. Alexi taught us how to dig into the Dictionaries. Shay helped us clean the code
  and we shared ideas and some scripts with Kelsey
  
Assignment #2. 
  William and I started on this code largely by modifying Assignment #1. We tried to use the  print to csv in the examples but meeting 
  with failure took Kelseys advice to look at a site she found through a Google search, http://michelleminkoff.com/2011/02/01/making-the-structured-usable-transform-json-into-a-csv/
  I was unable to get the script to work at first because I understood the problem incorrectly. I thought we were supposed to pass 
  two bus numbers in as arguments instead of one. After working with Himanshu he was able to describe my error and it was quickly resolved. 
  
Assignement #3. 
  I worked on this assignment on my own but after recieving advice from Danny about how to proceed. I had trouble getting my links to work
  even after meeting with Himanshu.  To rectify the problem I used the same data set as Danny and I was able to load the data.
