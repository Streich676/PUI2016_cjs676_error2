For this Assignemnt I worked with Ben and Geoff extensively. Additionally we all worked with Johnathan, Danny and Kristi. 

Assignment #1






Assignment #2


In this assignement Ben and I had trouble with question#3 and the analytic plot. We worked with Himanshu to figure out why the graph did not look the way we wanted. 




Assignment #3
Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?

  H0: Null Hypothesis: 
  Null hypothesis: The test population exhibits no fat loss or less fat loss than the control population. Population mean       difference is zero at a significance level of .05%.

  HA: Alternative hypothesis: There is a difference in average fat lost in
  the test versus the control population. Population mean difference is not zero. 
  control population = CG
  Test population = TP
  H0: CP fat loss <= TP fat loss
  HA: CP fat loss > TP fat loss
  
  Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.
  

Do American trust the president?
POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.

  H0: The proportion of Americans who say they do not trust the president is greater or equal to the proportion of Americans     who say they do not trust the president at a significance level of .05%
  
  Ha: The proportion of Americans who say they trust the president is greater than the proportion of Americans who say they     trust the President. 
  H0: Trust <= Not Trust
  H1: Trust > Not Trust

Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.
Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.

  H0: Cessation rates for the control group using the placebo patch is the same or greater than the cessation rate for those     using the nicotene tab at a significance of .05%.
  
  HA: Cessation rates for the test group using the nicotene patch is greater than the cessation rate for those in the control   group using the placebo patch. 
  
  H0: Cessation with Nicotene =< Cessation with Placebo
  HA: Cessation with Nicotene >= Cessation with Placebo
  

Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

  H0: Children of women who smoke while pregeneant will have the same mean IQ at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age as the IQ
  of Children whose Mothers did not smoke while pregeant. 
  HA: Children of women who smoke while pregeneant will different mean IQ at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age as the IQ
  of Children whose Mothers did not smoke while pregeant. 

  H0: Smoke IQ means = Not Smoke IQ means. 
  HA: Smoke IQ means <> Not smoke IQ means.
